# Google System Design Remote Agent Configuration

# This agent runs as a standalone A2A server and does NOT require any environment
# variables or API keys. It uses deterministic, keyword-based evaluation.

# If you plan to extend this agent to use external LLM services for evaluation,
# uncomment and configure the following:

# Google AI API Key (optional, for future LLM-based features)
# Get your API key from: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
