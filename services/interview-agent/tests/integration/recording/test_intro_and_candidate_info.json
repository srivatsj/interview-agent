    "text": "That sounds incredibly impressive, Sarah! Scaling Netflix microservices to 100M users and building payment infrastructure at Stripe are fantastic achievements.\n\nHere's how today's system design interview will work: We'll go through a problem together, starting with clarifying the requirements and defining the scope. Then, we'll move into designing the data model, API, and overall architecture. We'll also have time to deep dive into specific components. It's a collaborative discussion, not a test, so please feel free to ask questions and think out loud. The whole interview will take about 45-60 minutes.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"
