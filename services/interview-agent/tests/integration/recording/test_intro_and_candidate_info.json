Scaling Netflix microservices and building payment infrastructure at Stripe really highlights your expertise.\n\nHere's how today's system design interview will work: We'll go through a problem together covering clarifications, requirements, data modeling, API design, architecture, and then potentially dive deep into specific areas. It's a collaborative discussion, so please feel free to ask questions, share your thoughts, and explore different approaches out loud. The whole thing usually takes about 45-60 minutes.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"
