Scaling Netflix microservices to 100M users and building payment infrastructure at Stripe are significant accomplishments.\n\nHere's how today's system design interview will work: We'll start by clarifying the problem and gathering requirements, then move on to designing a data model and API. After that, we'll outline the overall architecture and deep dive into specific components. It's a collaborative discussion, not a test, so please feel free to ask questions and think out loud. The whole session will be approximately 45-60 minutes.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"
