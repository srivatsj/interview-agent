I'd love to hear your thoughts on some key aspects. How do you envision the **scale** of this service in terms of daily active users, queries per second, and data volume?"

Bitly handles a massive amount of traffic, so let's think big.\n\nRegarding **scale**, what are your initial thoughts on:\n\n*   **Queries per second (QPS)** for both URL shortening (write operations) and URL redirection (read operations)?\n*   **Number of unique shortened URLs** we might need to store?\n*   **Data storage requirements** over, say, 5-10 years?\n\nDon't worry about being precise, just give me your estimates and the reasoning behind them. This helps us understand the magnitude of the problem we're solving."

This is a crucial step as it informs many of our design decisions for the data layer.\n\nWe still need to cover:\n1.  **Database choice** (SQL vs NoSQL)\n2.  **Schema** (tables, fields, relationships)\n3.  **Indexing strategy**\n4.  **Sharding/partitioning**\n5.  **Replication**\n\nBefore we move on, could you please share your estimates for the scale aspects we just discussed? For instance:\n\n*   How many **shorten requests per second** do you anticipate?\n*   How many **redirection requests per second**?\n*   What's your estimate for the **total number of unique shortened URLs** we'd need to store over time?\n\nOnce we have a better understanding of the scale, we can proceed with the rest of the data layer design."
