# Meta (LangGraph) System Design Remote Agent Configuration

# This agent runs as a standalone A2A server using a deterministic LangGraph
# state machine. It does NOT require any environment variables or API keys.

# The agent uses keyword-based evaluation and state transitions without
# external LLM calls, making it fast and cost-free.

# If you plan to extend this agent to use LLM-based evaluation, uncomment
# and configure the following:

# GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
# or
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
