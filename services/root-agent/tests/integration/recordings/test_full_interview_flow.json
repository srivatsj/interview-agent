It's great to hear about your experience in distributed systems and backend, and those projects sound very interesting.\n\nHere's how today's system design interview will work: We'll go through a problem together, covering clarifications, requirements, data modeling, API design, architecture, and then dive deep into specific areas. It's a collaborative discussion \u2013 feel free to ask questions and think out loud. The whole thing takes about 45-60 minutes.\n\nAre you ready to begin?"

Keep exploring those complex system challenges!"
